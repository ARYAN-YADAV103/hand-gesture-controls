# ✋ Hand Gesture Control System

A computer vision-based project that detects and recognizes hand gestures using a webcam, enabling users to control applications and devices with simple hand movements.

---

## 📸 Overview

This project utilizes a combination of OpenCV for image processing and a hand detection/tracking model (like Mediapipe or a custom CNN) to recognize real-time hand gestures captured from a webcam. Recognized gestures can trigger various system actions such as:

- Controlling media playback
- Adjusting system volume
- Moving the mouse cursor
- Custom application controls
